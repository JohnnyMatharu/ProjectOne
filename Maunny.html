<!--To import a Google Font, you can copy the font's URL from the Google Fonts library and then paste it in your HTML. For this challenge, we'll import the Lobster font. To do this, copy the following code snippet and paste it into the top of your code editor (before the opening style element):
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
Now you can use the Lobster font in your CSS by using Lobster as the FAMILY_NAME as in the following example:
font-family: FAMILY_NAME, GENERIC_NAME;.
The GENERIC_NAME is optional, and is a fallback font in case the other specified font is not available. This is covered in the next challenge.
Family names are case-sensitive and need to be wrapped in quotes if there is a space in the name. For example, you need quotes to use the "Open Sans" font, but not to use the Lobster font.

Import the Lobster font to your web page. Then, use an element selector to set Lobster as the font-family for your h2 element.

<!--Your cat photo currently has sharp corners. We can round out those corners with a CSS property called border-radius.

You can specify a border-radius with pixels. Give your cat photo a border-radius of 10px.
Note: This challenge allows for multiple possible solutions. For example, you may add border-radius to either the .thick-green-border class or the .smaller-image class.


Make Circular Images with a border-radius
Passed
Passed
In addition to pixels, you can also specify the border-radius using a percentage.

Give your cat photo a border-radius of 50%.

Try to set the margin to a negative value like the one for the red box.
Change the margin of the blue box to -15px, so it fills the entire horizontal width of the yellow box around it.

The two main types of length units are absolute and relative. Absolute units tie to physical units of length. For example, in and mm refer to inches and millimeters, respectively. Absolute length units approximate the actual measurement on a screen, but there are some differences depending on a screen's resolution.
Relative units, such as em or rem, are relative to another length value. For example, em is based on the size of an element's font. If you use it to set the font-size property itself, it's relative to the parent's font-size.
Note: There are several relative unit options that are tied to the size of the viewport. They are covered in the Responsive Web Design Principles section.

Add a padding property to the element with class red-box and set it to 1.5em.

Inherit Styles from the Body Element
Passed
Passed
Now we've proven that every HTML page has a body element, and that its body element can also be styled with CSS.
Remember, you can style your body element just like any other HTML element, and all your other elements will inherit your body element's styles.

First, create a h1 element with the text Hello World
Then, let's give all elements on your page the color of green by adding color: green; to your body element's style declaration.
Finally, give your body element the font-family of monospace by adding font-family: monospace; to your body element's style declaration

Use Hex Code for Specific Colors
Passed
Passed
Did you know there are other ways to represent colors in CSS? One of these ways is called hexadecimal code, or hex code for short.
We usually use decimals, or base 10 numbers, which use the symbols 0 to 9 for each digit. Hexadecimals (or hex) are base 16 numbers. This means it uses sixteen distinct symbols. Like decimals, the symbols 0-9 represent the values zero to nine. Then A,B,C,D,E,F represent the values ten to fifteen. Altogether, 0 to F can represent a digit in hexadecimal, giving us 16 total possible values. You can find more information about hexadecimal numbers here.
In CSS, we can use 6 hexadecimal digits to represent colors, two each for the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) components. For example, #000000 is black and is also the lowest possible value. You can find more information about the RGB color system here.
body {
  color: #000000;
}

Replace the word black in our body element's background-color with its hex code representation, #000000

———————————

To review, hex codes use 6 hexadecimal digits to represent colors, two each for red (R), green (G), and blue (B) components.
From these three pure colors (red, green, and blue), we can vary the amounts of each to create over 16 million other colors!
For example, orange is pure red, mixed with some green, and no blue. In hex code, this translates to being #FFA500.
The digit 0 is the lowest number in hex code, and represents a complete absence of color.
The digit F is the highest number in hex code, and represents the maximum possible brightness.

Replace the color words in our style element with their correct hex codes.

#00FF00
Orange
#FFA500
Red
#FF0000


Use Abbreviated Hex Code
Passed
Passed
Many people feel overwhelmed by the possibilities of more than 16 million colors. And it's difficult to remember hex code. Fortunately, you can shorten it.
For example, red's hex code #FF0000 can be shortened to #F00. This shortened form gives one digit for red, one digit for green, and one digit for blue.
This reduces the total number of possible colors to around 4,000. But browsers will interpret #FF0000 and #F00 as exactly the same color.

Go ahead, try using the abbreviated hex codes to color the correct elements.

#0FF

Use RGB values to Color Elements
Passed
Passed
Another way you can represent colors in CSS is by using RGB values.
The RGB value for black looks like this:
rgb(0, 0, 0)
The RGB value for white looks like this:
rgb(255, 255, 255)
Instead of using six hexadecimal digits like you do with hex code, with RGB you specify the brightness of each color with a number between 0 and 255.
If you do the math, the two digits for one color equal 16 times 16, which gives us 256 total values. So RGB, which starts counting from zero, has the exact same number of possible values as hex code.
Here's an example of how you'd change the body background to orange using its RGB code.

-->
body {
  background-color: rgb(255, 165, 0);
}

<!--
Let's replace the hex code in our body element's background color with the RGB value for black: rgb(0, 0, 0)

Replace the hex codes in our style element with their correct RGB values.

rgb(0, 0, 255)

Orchid
rgb(218, 112, 214)

Create a custom CSS Variable
Passed
Passed
To create a CSS variable, you just need to give it a name with two hyphens in front of it and assign it a value like this:
-->
--penguin-skin: gray;
<!--
This will create a variable named --penguin-skin and assign it the value of gray. Now you can use that variable elsewhere in your CSS to change the value of other elements to gray.

In the penguin class, create a variable name --penguin-skin and give it a value of gray.



Use a custom CSS Variable
Passed
Passed
After you create your variable, you can assign its value to other CSS properties by referencing the name you gave it.
-->
background: var(--penguin-skin);
<!--
This will change the background of whatever element you are targeting to gray because that is the value of the --penguin-skin variable. Note that styles will not be applied unless the variable names are an exact match.

Apply the --penguin-skin variable to the background property of the penguin-top, penguin-bottom, right-hand and left-hand classes.

Inherit CSS Variables
Passed
Passed
When you create a variable, it is available for you to use inside the selector in which you create it. It also is available in any of that selector's descendants. This happens because CSS variables are inherited, just like ordinary properties.
To make use of inheritance, CSS variables are often defined in the

element.

:root is a pseudo-class selector that matches the root element of the document, usually the html element. By creating your variables in :root, they will be available globally and can be accessed from any other selector in the style sheet.

Define a variable named --penguin-belly in the :root selector and give it the value of pink. You can then see that the variable is inherited and that all the child elements which use it get pink backgrounds
